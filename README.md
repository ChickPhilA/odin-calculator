This is the Calculator project from The Odin Project's foundations curriculum. The purpose of this project is to practice and utilize the foundations of all foundational concepts of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript that I learned through The Odin Project.

This is the very last project of the Foundations curricilum of The Odin Project and I can't believe how much progress I have made ever since I have started this course. It may be a long journey but I personally believe that all of my hard work will be worth it in the long run. As I develop this project and create every push to my repository, may every small step be a progress of growth in my path of becoming a Full Stack Developer. :)

UPDATE (10/13/2025): Finally finished the calculator! Not the best but did the fullest to my ability. Will update in future pushes to refine decimal and long number computation, as well as quality of life to calculator UI functionality.
